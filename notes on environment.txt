I had to manually edit the environments.yaml

dont't use requirements for conda, doesn't include pip

cuda won't install from the environments.yaml, just remove it and install on iridis


using cmd

tjc2g19@iridis5.soton.ac.uk

pip install -e git+https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt.git@b32d589d12d31ba3c8a9cfb7a3c85c6e350b2904#egg=rlpyt
